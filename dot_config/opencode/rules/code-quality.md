# Code Quality Rules

## General Principles
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Write unit tests for critical functionality

## Code Organization
- Use consistent file and directory structure
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns (business logic, data access, presentation)
- Follow established design patterns when appropriate
- Document complex algorithms and business rules

## Performance Considerations
- Avoid premature optimization, but be aware of performance implications
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Minimize database queries and network calls
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Consider memory usage and garbage collection

## Maintainability
- Write code that is easy to understand and modify
- Use meaningful comments for complex logic
- Follow consistent coding style and conventions
- Avoid magic numbers and hardcoded values
- Refactor code regularly to improve quality

## Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Make atomic commits that represent single logical changes
- Use branching strategies appropriate for the project
- Review code before merging to main branch
- Tag releases and document changes
